      <p>Hi, my name is Samson and i am a very bad coding guy<br>
        who wishes i can code like a pro, i am 13 years old<br>
        (so no ban me from github) who likes to learn code<br>
        for example i like to learn css since i mostly know<br>
        a lot about html and i am pretty good at it, i was<br>
        always a fan of coding after watching people code games<br>
        using C#, like brackeys, they helped inspired me to learn.<br>

    <h3>what you need to know about me is..</h3>
    
    <ul>
      <li>i am bad at coding</li>
      <li>i want to be a game developer as my future compassion</li>
      <li>i get distracted in video games</li>
      <li>i want to learn lua and C# in the future</li>
      <li>i am pretty good at HTML and am learning css</li>
      
    </ul>
       
 
            <h2>why i wanna learn code</h2>
      
    <p>ok so first reason is because i am <em><strong>jealous that my friends can do code</em></strong><br>
    and i can't, but thats fine, i don't want my friends coding skills to ruin my<br>
    day so i just open up my laptop and get coding, <strong>but oh wait i don't know how to<br>
      code</strong>. So yes the reason is because im jealous that my friend can and i can't <br>
    (by the way i also want to make games and cool stuff with it)</p>
    
    <p>i am making progress right now, but i still suck at coding (every code) but i am 50% good at HTML<p>
