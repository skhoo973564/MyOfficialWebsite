            <h2>why i wanna learn code</h2>
      
       <p>i always wanted to do code because it makes me feel smart and i always wanted to make games<br>
         using code, so i usually go to <strong>roblox studio</strong> and start working on some game projects, but since<br>
         roblox studios uses lua, i don't know lua, so i just grab items from the model section and make<br>
         my game without any code, but i consider it being <strong>lazy</strong> since <strong>its not <em>actual</em> coding and game engines<br>
         tell you to use code to make games or else it just means your a total failure</strong>. i wanna learn code because<br>
         i love making games and building websites. Right i'm learning html, which i'm pretty good at it, so<br>
         so i'm learning css as well to make my website look better.</p>
